# AWS Lambda [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) docker builder üêë ü¶Ä üê≥ [![Build Status](https://github.com/softprops/lambda-rust/workflows/Main/badge.svg)](https://github.com/softprops/lambda-rust/actions)


## ü§î about

This docker image extends [lambda ci `provided.al2`](https://github.com/lambci/docker-lambda#documentation) builder docker image, a faithful reproduction of the actual AWS "**provided.al2**" Lambda runtime environment,
and installs [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) and the *stable* rust toolchain.

This provides a build environment, consistent with your target execution environment for predictable results.

## üì¶ install

Tags for this docker image follow the naming convention `softprops/lambda-rust:{version}-rust-{rust-stable-version}`
where `{rust-stable-version}` is a stable version of rust.

You can find a list of available docker tags [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/softprops/lambda-rust/tags)

> üí° If you don't find the version you're looking for, please [open a new github issue](https://github.com/softprops/lambda-rust/issues/new?title=I%27m%20looking%20for%20version%20xxx) to publish one

You can also depend directly on `softprops/lambda-rust:latest` for the most recently published version.

## ü§∏ usage

The default docker entrypoint will build a packaged release optimized version of your Rust artifact under `target/lambda/release` to
isolate the lambda specific build artifacts from your host-local build artifacts.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** you can switch from the `release` profile to a custom profile like `dev` by providing a `PROFILE` environment variable set to the name of the desired profile. i.e. `-e PROFILE=dev` in your docker run

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** you can include debug symbols in optimized release build binaries by setting `DEBUGINFO`. By default, debug symbols will be stripped from the release binary and set aside in a separate .debug file.

You will want to volume mount `/code` to the directory containing your cargo project.

You can pass additional flags to `cargo`, the Rust build tool, by setting the `CARGO_FLAGS` docker env variable.

Unzipped `boostrap` and `boostrap.debug` files are always available
under `target/lambda/${PROFILE}/output/${BIN}` dir. If you want only them and don't
need a `.zip` archive (e.g. for when running lambdas locally) pass `-e PACKAGE=false`
flag. More on that in [local testing](#-local-testing).

A typical docker run might look like the following.

```sh
$ docker run --rm \
    -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    -v ${PWD}:/code \
    -v ${HOME}/.cargo/registry:/cargo/registry \
    -v ${HOME}/.cargo/git:/cargo/git \
    softprops/lambda-rust
```
> üí° The -v (volume mount) flags for `/cargo/{registry,git}` are optional but when supplied, provides a much faster turn around when doing iterative development

Note that `-u $(id -u):$(id -g)` argument is crucial for the container to produce artifacts
owned by the current host user, otherwise you won't be able to `rm -rf target/lambda`
or run `cargo update`, because the container will write artifacts owned by `root` docker user
to `target/lambda` and `./cargo/{registry,git}` dirs which will break your dev and/or ci environment.

You should also ensure that you do have `${HOME}/.cargo/{registry,git}` dirs created
on your host machine, otherwise docker will create them automatically and assign `root` user
as an owner for these dirs which is unfortunate...

If you are using Windows, the command above may need to be modified to include
a `BIN` environment variable set to the name of the binary to be build and packaged

```diff
$ docker run --rm \
    -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
+   -e BIN={your-binary-name} \
    -v ${PWD}:/code \
    -v ${HOME}/.cargo/registry:/cargo/registry \
    -v ${HOME}/.cargo/git:/cargo/git \
    softprops/lambda-rust
```

For more custom codebases, the '-w' argument can be used to override the working directory.
This can be especially useful when using path dependencies for local crates.

```sh
$ docker run --rm \
    -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    -v ${PWD}/lambdas/mylambda:/code/lambdas/mylambda \
    -v ${PWD}/libs/mylib:/code/libs/mylib \
    -v ${HOME}/.cargo/registry:/cargo/registry \
    -v ${HOME}/.cargo/git:/cargo/git \
    -w /code/lambdas/mylambda \
    softprops/lambda-rust
```

## ‚öì using hooks

If you want to customize certain parts of the build process, you can leverage hooks that this image provides.
Hooks are just shell scripts that are invoked in a specific order, so you can customize the process as you wish. The following hooks exist:
* `install`: run before `cargo build` - useful for installing native dependencies on the lambda environment
* `build`: run after `cargo build`, but before packaging the executable into a zip - useful when modifying the executable after compilation
* `package`: run after packaging the executable into a zip - useful for adding extra files into the zip file

The hooks' names are predefined and must be placed in a directory `.lambda-rust` in the project root.

You can take a look at an example [here](./tests/test-func-with-hooks).

## üî¨ local testing

Once you've built a Rust lambda function artifact, the `provided.al2` runtime expects
deployments of that artifact to be named "**bootstrap**". The `lambda-rust` docker image
builds a zip file, named after the binary, containing your binary file renamed to "bootstrap" for you, but zip file creation is unnecessary for local development.

In order to prevent the creation of an intermediate `.zip` artifact when testing your lambdas locally, pass `-e PACKAGE=false` during the build. After that the necessary
output (not zipped) is available under `target/lambda/{profile}/output/{your-lambda-binary-name}` dir.
You will see both `bootstrap` and `bootstrap.debug` files there.
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** `PACKAGE=false` prevents `package` hook from running.

You can then invoke this bootstap executable with the lambda-ci docker image for the `provided.al2` AWS lambda runtime with a one off container.

```sh
# Build your function skipping the zip creation step
# You may pass `-e PROFILE=dev` to build using dev profile, but here we use `release`
docker run \
    -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    -e PACKAGE=false \
    -e BIN={your-binary-name} \
    -v ${PWD}:/code \
    -v ${HOME}/.cargo/registry:/cargo/registry \
    -v ${HOME}/.cargo/git:/cargo/git \
    softprops/lambda-rust

# start a one-off docker container replicating the "provided.al2" lambda runtime
# awaiting an event to be provided via stdin
$ docker run \
    -i -e DOCKER_LAMBDA_USE_STDIN=1 \
    --rm \
    -v ${PWD}/target/lambda/release/output/{your-binary-name}:/var/task:ro,delegated \
    lambci/lambda:provided.al2

# provide an event payload via stdin (typically a json blob)

# Ctrl-D to yield control back to your function
```

You may find the one-off container less than ideal if you wish to trigger your lambda multiple times. For these cases try using the "stay open" mode of execution.

```sh
# start a long running docker container replicating the "provided" lambda runtime
# listening on port 9001
$ unzip -o \
    target/lambda/release/{your-binary-name}.zip \
    -d /tmp/lambda && \
  docker run \
    --rm \
    -v /tmp/lambda:/var/task:ro,delegated \
    -e DOCKER_LAMBDA_STAY_OPEN=1 \
    -p 9001:9001 \
    lambci/lambda:provided.al2
```

In a separate terminal, you can invoke your function with `curl`

The `-d` flag is a means of providing your function's input.

```sh
$ curl -d '{}' \
    http://localhost:9001/2015-03-31/functions/myfunction/invocations
```

You can also use the `aws` cli to invoke your function locally.  The `--payload` is a means of providing your function's input.

```sh
$ aws lambda invoke \
    --endpoint http://localhost:9001 \
    --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
    --no-sign-request \
    --function-name myfunction \
    --payload '{}' out.json \
    && cat out.json \
    && rm -f out.json
```

## ü§∏ü§∏ usage via cargo aws-lambda subcommand

A third party cargo subcommand exists to compile your code into a zip file and deploy it. This comes with only
rust and docker as dependencies.

Setup

```sh
$ cargo install cargo-aws-lambda
```

To compile and deploy in your project directory
```sh
$ cargo aws-lambda {your aws function's full ARN} {your-binary-name}
```

To list all options
```sh
$ cargo aws-lambda --help
```
